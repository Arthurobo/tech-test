A simple web application where teachers can sign up, login to their account and update accounts and logged in users can add teachers through a csv file upload.

HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION
1. clone the repo with the command below;
    git clone https://github.com/Arthurobo/tech-test.git

2. Once it is cloned, cd into the teachers folder and install the dependencies with the command below;
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Once dependencies are installed, run the server with the command below;
    python manage.py runserver

Now your server is running, you can browse through the application. You can use a general user logged in details;

The above user is a superuser, you can run various django commands to test the application, thanks.
